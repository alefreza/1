Overview

The vSphere Replication Bandwidth Calculator Tool is designed to help users estimate the required bandwidth for replicating virtual machines (VMs) in a vSphere environment. This tool takes into account several parameters to calculate the optimal network bandwidth needed for smooth data replication with minimal latency, ensuring effective disaster recovery and data protection.
Features

Hypervisor-Based Calculation: Calculates bandwidth requirements based on vSphere Replication parameters.
    Asynchronous Replication: Estimates bandwidth for asynchronous replication scenarios.
    Customizable Parameters: Allows users to input various parameters such as VM size, replication frequency, and data change rate to obtain more accurate results.
    Multiple VM Support: Supports calculations for multiple VMs at once, making it easier to scale up for larger environments.
    Bandwidth Recommendations: Provides recommendations for minimum, average, and maximum bandwidth requirements based on user inputs.

System Requirements

    Operating System: Any Web Browser (depending on platform support for your tool)

Parameters

The tool calculates bandwidth based on the following key parameters. Ensure you provide accurate values for the most precise results:

*Number of VMs: The total number of the virtual machine.

*Disks per VM:The total Disks of the virtual machine.

*Disk Size (GB):The total size of the virtual machine (in GB).

*Capacity Utilization (%): The percentage of the total storage capacity currently being used (e.g., 70% means the VM is utilizing 70% of its allocated storage).

*Compression Enabled?: Whether data compression is enabled (True/False).

*Daily Change Rate (%): The percentage of the VM data that changes per day (as a decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5% daily change).

*Burst Change Rate (%): The percentage of VM data that experiences occasional burst changes (as a decimal, e.g., 0.1 for 10% burst).

*RPO (minutes): Recovery Point Objective in minutes, indicating the acceptable time window for data loss (e.g., 15 minutes).
